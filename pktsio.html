            <p> pkts.io is a pure java library for reading and writing pcaps. It's primary 
                purpose is to manipulate/analyze existing pcaps, allowing you to build various 
                tools around pcaps.

            <h3>Load a pcap</h3>
            <p>
               Example, load a pcap from file and print the content of each UDP packet to 
               standard out.
            </p>

{% highlight java linenos %}
final Pcap pcap = Pcap.openStream("my_traffic.pcap");

         <h3>Streams</h3>
         <p>
Pkts.io also contains a higher level of abstraction – streams. Quite often you may want to manipulate a stream of related messages and by using the stream support offered by pkts.io, you can do so. What a stream represents depends on the underlying protocol. E.g., for UDP, a stream is all the messages that is sent/received from the same local and remote port-pair. If you deal with SIP, all SIP messages that belongs to the same SIP Dialog are considered to belong to the same stream.
         </p>

         <p>Example, load a pcap from file and consume all SIP Streams. </p>
{% highlight java linenos %}
final Pcap pcap = Pcap.openStream("my_traffic.pcap");

final StreamHandler streamHandler = new DefaultStreamHandler();

streamHandler.addStreamListener(new StreamListener<SipPacket>() {
    @Override
    public void startStream(final Stream<SipPacket> stream, final SipPacket packet) {
        System.out.println("New SIP stream detected. Stream id: " 
                          + stream.getStreamIdentifier());
        System.out.println("SipMessage was: " + packet.getInitialLine());
    }

    @Override
    public void packetReceived(final Stream<SipPacket> stream, final SipPacket packet) {
        System.out.println("Received a new SIP message for stream: " 
                          + stream.getStreamIdentifier());
        System.out.println("SipMessage was: " + packet.getInitialLine());
    }

    @Override
    public void endStream(final Stream<SipPacket> stream) {
        System.out.println("The stream ended. Stream id: " 
                          + stream.getStreamIdentifier());
    }

            <h3>Consume It</h3>
            <p>pkts.io is available through Maven Central so just include the following Maven artifact and you are good to go:

            {% endhighlight %}
            <p> Or if you want to use the stream support, then just include the following:

            <p> So, you have succerssfully loaded all the code so what is the next steps. Well, check out the readme files under each sub-project to get a description of what that module is supposed to do and how to get started with the project. If you want to contribute to any project, please read the section about contribution, specifially, please checkout the section about coding principles and the style guide.

            <h3>Code Principals</h3>
            <p> At aboutsip, we try to follow these general principles and by adhering to these simple guidelines, we feel that our code is more readable, easier to follow and is testable (even though we can always do better so please give us constructive feedback):
            <ul>
                <li>Write code so others can read and understand it.</li>
                <li>Write testable code.</li>
                <li>Unit tests everything, but no need to strive for 100%.</li>
                <li>A method should not be longer than a page (if it is, you probably can split it up).</li>
                <li>Javadoc everything! Please describe what each class/interface is supposed to do. If you cannot explain it, then no one else will be able to understand it either. Each method should be documented. Describe what the method is supposed to do. If you end up writing an essay about the method, perhaps it is too complicated?</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

         <div class="col-xs-12" id="contributing-style-guide">
            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p> Please follow the style already in place. If you are an Eclipse user, follow the guidelines for Eclipse below and please load the formatting template and then you won't even have to think about it, Eclipse will do it for you.
            </p>
            <p>In general, the aboutsip code base is following regular java style convention but here are the more important points (and some differences)
            <ul>
                <li>No tabs – ever</li>
                <li>Indent is 4 spaces</li>
                <li>The line width is 120 characters so please do not cut it off at 80 (we all have screens with high enough resolution these days).</li>
                <li>Use final everywhere! (once again, you can have Eclipse fix this for you).</li>
                <li>Use this everywhere! (Eclipse will fix it for you)</li>
