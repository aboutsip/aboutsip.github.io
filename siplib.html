            <h1>SIP Lib</h1>
            <p>SIP Lib is part of pkts.io and is a complete SIP library for framing, parsing and representing SIP messages, headers and addresses.  All objects are immutable, has a modern &amp; fluent API and makes use of the latest Java 8 language features, allowing the developer to be focused on what needs to get done as opposed to how. 
            </p>
            <p>The motivation for writing SIP Lib is that the existing SIP libraries out there are quite old, does not make use of modern design principals and language features and moreover, they are typical mutable and rely on side effects, which makes it very hard to reason about what will actually happen once you deploy your code into a multi threaded environment.
            </p>
            <p>Finally, another explicit goal of SIP Lib was to make it a standalone module so that it can easily be consumed by a variety of applications, whether it be a “real” SIP stack or a simple one-off tool that you may need build in order to make your life easier.
            </p>

            <h3>Parse a SIP Message</h3>
            <p>This is the most basic example showing how you can parse a SIP
               message based off of a String. In this example, we are the ones
               creating that raw message ourselves but typically you would read
               this off of the network, or perhaps from a file if you are building
               a tool of some sort.
            </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Just create a String with a properly formatted SIP message. As previously pointed out, normally you wouldn't
                        create a SIP message manually like this but rather read a stream of bytes off of the network, or perhaps from a text
                        file in case you are building some kind of tool. However, this is just an example so we are doing it the
                        hard way...
                    </li>
                    <li>Every object in SIP Lib has a frame-method, which
                        will attempt to frame the raw content into that object.
                        This is true for SIP messages, SIP headers, SIP URIs
                        etc etc. All frame-methods are overloaded and accept
                        Strings, Buffers and byte-arrays.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once the message has successfully been parsed you can access headers etc within the SIP message.
                    </li>
                    <li>All headers that are typically needed for any application, and
                        in particular for SIP stacks, have explicit methods and returns
                        explicit objects. You may still use the generic getHeader but then
                        you will get a generic SIP header back.
                    </li>
                    <li>Instead of having to do SipMessage.getMethod().equals("BYE") etc
                        the SipMessage class has many convenience methods for making the code
                        more readable, less error prone and less boiler plate to write.
                    </li>

         <h3>Create a SIP Request</h3>
         <p>All objects within SIP Lib are immutable. Hence, once an object, such as a
            SipMessage, a SipHeader or a e.g. a SipURI has been
            constructed you cannot change it. Therefore, all objects within SIP Lib make
            use of the builder pattern, allowing the user to construct the desired object.
         </p>
{% highlight java linenos %}
 final SipRequest invite = SipRequest.invite("sip:alice@aboutsip.com")
         .withFromHeader("sip:bob@pkts.io")
         .build();
{% endhighlight %}
         <p>The SipRequest object contains convenience methods for creating a particular SIP request, 
            such as an INVITE. The object returned from this method is a SipMessage.Builder-object, 
            which allows you to continue constructing the object before finally building it. 
            Once built, you cannot change it.
         </p>
         </div>

     <div id="intro-create-sip-response">
         <h3>Create a SIP Response</h3>
         <p>Creating responses is typically done based off a request and SIP Lib
            allows you to do so but of course, the object returned will be a builder.
         </p>

{% highlight java linenos %}
  final SipRequest invite = SipRequest.invite("sip:alice@aboutsip.com")
          .withFromHeader("sip:bob@pkts.io")
          .build();

  final SipResponse response = invite.createResponse(200)
          .withHeader(SipHeader.create("X-Hello", "World"))
          .build();
{% endhighlight %}

         <p>The SipRequest object has a convenience method for creating a response based off of it and will return
            a new SIP response builder object. In this example, for good measure, we also added a generic header
            to the response before we built it.
